      <p>Hi! This is Edy!</p>
      <p>This is my short story... :D</p>
      <p>
        I've been immersed in coding since my last year in junior high at SMP
        Katolik Santu Petrus Kota Pontianak, particularly for competitive
        programming competitions. During this time, I primarily worked on
        logical exercises and programming tasks related to data structures. I
        used Pascal, with Free Pascal IDE, to write solutions for these tasks.
        My involvement in competitive programming continued throughout my senior
        years, culminating in my highest achievement as a national finalist in
        Medan in 2010.

        Following my high school graduation, I worked as a math teacher,
        tutoring senior high students for a couple of years. During my
        university years, around semester 4 or 5, I joined the university's IT
        department (UPT Pusat Komputer Universitas Tanjungpura) as a staff
        member. In this role, I was tasked with developing applications such as
        E-Office (mostly PHP, jQuery-based web application) for university
        administration. Although the application was successfully deployed, I
        wasn't entirely certain about its implementation. Another significant
        project I undertook during this time was creating a geographic
        information system to store bridge information for a city in Kalimantan
        Barat using Delphi.

      <p>
        My career accelerated rapidly from there. In addition to my role as a
        developer, I volunteered in various developer community activities,
        including Female Dev Chapter Pontianak, Google Day (Widya Dharma), and
        IAK (Indonesia Android Kejar) Chapter Pontianak. It was during this
        period that I crossed paths with the founder of Turbin, the company I
        currently work for.

      <p>
        Throughout this journey, I've learned many valuable lessons. One of the
        most significant realizations for me was that technology isn't just
        about dealing with machines; it's primarily about humans. As developers,
        we have the important task of serving as translators, creating tools to
        empower and assist people.
